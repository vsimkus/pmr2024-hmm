    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "When we are learning a new language, we have to learn, among many other things, the grammar of the language as well as its vocabulary. In the `HMM basics` notebook, we have introduced latent sentence templates that we can use to construct sentences, e.g. Subject -> Verb -> Object. The latent sentence templates were given by a hidden Markov chain. We can think that this hidden Markov chain, i.e. the latent variables together with the transition distribution, corresponds to a simple model of the grammar of the language. In turn, proper use of the vocabulary means knowing when one can use a given word. We can think that the emission distribution corresponds to a simple model of the proper use of the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a supervised setting, e.g. when learning a language from a textbook, we may have annotations of the hidden states together with the used words. For example\n",
    " - sentences: `['I like dogs', 'I really love cats']`;\n",
    " - annotations: `[[Subject, Verb, Object], [Subject, Adverb, Verb, Object]]`.\n",
    " \n",
    "When we have observations on the hidden variables, the learning problem is simpler: we can use standard maximum likelihood estimation for discrete random variables as with directed acyclic graphs. We have seen that this corresponds to frequency counting of words and annotations, and their co-occurences. Hence, given data on the state of the hidden variables, we could simply count the frequency of \n",
    "1. the states $k$ of the first hidden variable $h_1$ as $a_k$, \n",
    "2. transitions from hidden state $k'$ to $k$ as $A_{k',k}$, and\n",
    "3. emitting word $m$ from hidden state $k$ as $B_{m,k}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Counting would thus allow us to learn the parameters of the HMM.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, what if we do not have such annotations? The languages that we speak emerged naturally through complex social interactions and not from a concrete set of hidden grammar rules. So is it possible for computers to learn the grammar and use of vocabulary automatically without supervision? Yes, with some limitations, it can be done using HMMs and unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained in the lecture, we can iteratively learn the parameters of an HMM model solely from observed sentences via the Baum-Welch algorithm, which consists of two steps: \n",
    "1. *Expectation*-step (E-step), where the expected log-likelihood is computed on filled-in data using the current parameters of the model and the inference algorithms implemented in the previous notebooks,\n",
    "2. *Maximisation*-step (M-step), where updated parameters are computed such that they maximise the expectation from the E-step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we implement the Baum-Welch algorithm, we also have to represent the parametrisation of the HMM in terms of variables in computer code which we do next."

    "# Parametrisation of discrete HMM\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the slides in the lecture and the example in the `HMM basics` notebook, we model the homogeneous discrete HMM model with the following three parameters:\n",
    "1. `_initial_`: the distribution over initial hidden states, which is implemented as a vector with shape `(num_hiddens,)`. It corresponds to the vector $\\mathbf{a}\\in\\mathbb{R}^K$ introduced in the lecture where $a_k=p(h_1=k;\\mathbf{a})$.\n",
    "2. `_transition_`: the transition probability between the hidden states, which is implemented as a matrix with shape `(num_hiddens, num_hiddens)`. It corresponds to the matrix $\\mathbf{A}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{K\\times K}$ introduced in the lecture. In this notebook, we follow the convention $A_{k',k}=p(h_i=k | h_{i-1}=k'; \\mathbf{A})$ for ease of implementation, which is the *transpose* of the matrix in the slides.\n",
    "3. `_emission_`: the emission probability from a hidden state to an observation, which is implemented as a matrix with shape `(num_observations, num_states)`. It corresponds to the vector $\\mathbf{B}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{M\\times K}$ introduced in the lecture where $B_{m,k}=p(v_i=m|h_i=k; \\mathbf{B})$.\n",

    "We implement the unsupervised learning algorithm in an object-oriented manner. We here define the \n",

    "\n",
    "The *attributes* of this class are:\n",
    " 1. `model`: the HMM model whose parameters we would like to fit. The `HMM` model class is implemented in [`hmm.py`](./hmm.py), which includes the inference operations implemented in the previous notebooks.\n",
    " 2. `num_hiddens`: an integer that specifies the number of possible hidden states. Since we do not know the *real* number of hidden states in the unsupervised setting, this is a tunable hyper-parameter in the [Baum-Welch algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baum%E2%80%93Welch_algorithm).\n",
    " 3. `num_observations`: an integer that specifies the number of possible observed states. To handle the situations where the test data may contain observed states that do not appear in the training data, we can set this number to more than all the observed states in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *methods* of the  `HMMOptimiser` class are:\n",
    "1. `__init__`: initialises the optimiser with the provided arguments.\n",
    "2. `baum_welch`: implements the Baum-Welch algorithm, which iteratively invokes the following two methods to update the parameters:\n",
    "    1. `_e_step`: implements the expectation step by using the `marginal` method from the `HMM` class.\n",
    "    2. `_m_step`: implements the maximisation step.\n",
    "    3. `_initial_params_`: initialises the parameters.\n",
    "    4. `_stop_criterion_`: checks if the iterations should be stopped.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details of each method please read the comments provided in the `HMMOptimiser` class in [`optimiser.py`](./optimiser.py) that contains all the code in one file.\n",

Similarly, by recursion $\\alpha_i(k)$ for all $i$ are constant, since $p(h_i = k \\mid h_{i - 1} = k') = A_{k', k}$ is constant for all $k$ and $k'$. The same argument applies to $\\beta_i(k)$ for all $i$, which is constant for all $k$.

    "Having implemented the parameter initialisation method and the E/M-steps above, we can now run the loop of the Baum-Welch algorithm.\n",
    "However there is still one more remaining question: when should we stop iterating?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some heuristic criteria:\n",
    " 1. *small change of parameters*: if a local maxima is reached, then the derivative of the parameters would be 0. Therefore, there should be no change of parameters in the M-step either, and hence we can stop the iterations.\n",
    " 2. *small change of likelihood*: alternatively, we can stop the iteration if the change of (log-)likelihood of the model given the data becomes small. Note that the log-likelihood is available as a by-product from the computation of the marginal and joint of the latents that are needed in the E-step.\n",
    " 3. *number of steps*: sometimes our initialisation might be particularly bad, then it may take a very long time for the learning to converge (in terms of the above criteria). To avoid excessive number of iterations we can set a maximum number of iterations and stop the loop immediately if the maximum number of iterations is exceeded.\n",
    " 4. *mix*: in practice a mixture of the above criteria is most often used.\n",
    " \n",
    "Below we ask you to fill in the code for the stopping criterion. The algorithm should stop when the maximum number of steps is exceeded, the change in parameters (`delta_param`) is less than $10^{-16}$, or the change in the log-likelihood (`delta_logpx`) is less than $10^{-8}$."

    " 2. *Variance of the learnt parameter distance to the true parameters decreases with more data*: the more observed sequences we have for learning, the smaller the variance of the distance between the learnt parameter values and the true values.\n",
    " 3. *Parameters do not diverge if true parameters are used in initialisation*: if we use the true parameters to initialise the parameters of the `HMM`, the parameters should stay around the initial values during learning. Note that the true parameters might not be the optimal values for a particular dataset sample due to the finite sample size.\n",
